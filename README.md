# Social-Media-Buttons
An early Velocity experiment from the 2012-13 academic year in getting data from a user and displaying appropriatley formatted content. This was my first ground-up Velocity project and is provided here for pure nostaligia. The project would eventually grow and split-off and become the much imporved and portable Button Block.
